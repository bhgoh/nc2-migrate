Prior to any DR setup, you will need to prepare the clusters:

- To enable Disaster Recovery
- Connecting both source and target clusters in a new Availability Zone.

:::note
The following steps have already been performed by the instructor, as enabling Disaster 
Recovery and configuring the Availability Zone are one-time operations per Prism Central instance.

## Enable Disaster Recovery

1.  Login to source Prism Central.

2.  At the bottom of the left panel, click on **Prism Central Settings**. A blade on the left will display
    the settings.
