Nutanix Disaster Recovery is design to take away complexity for customer for their BCDR requirements.
Built-in as part of Nutanix Entperprise Cloud, it's simple to operate and once set, makes it flexible 
to change should business requirements sway.

As part of this exercise, you will observe the following:
