## Setup Move

To migrate, we'll log in to the Move VM and setup the environments and migration plan.

1. Login to Prism Central

   - username - PC login adminuser##@ntnxlab.local or adminuser##
   - password - PC password from Connection Details

2. Navigate to Compute & Storage > VMs

3. A Move VM per user called **User##-Move** has already been created. Look for that VM 
in the main page or you can search in the search bar. Make a note of its IP address.

:::info
In the Cluster Look Up Sheet, you should see the assigned VMs against your name. There will be 10 users 
to each cluster in these labs.

example :

User01, User02, User03, User04 to User10 will map to Cluster PHX-POC196, NC2-HPOC-90vsfj

User01, User02, User03, User04 to User10 will map to Cluster PHC-POC083, NC2-HPOC-t7yi1i

and so on

4. Open a new tab in browser within the VDI session and go to that IP address to open Move. 
If it says "Your connection is not private", click **Advanced** and then **Proceed to x.x.x.x (unsafe)**.

5. Accept the Terms and Conditions and click **Continue**. Click **Ok** on the next screen.

6. First, it will ask you to set a password. Set **ntnxNc2!** as the password. That way those sharing
the clusters will be able to access them as well.

7. Login using the same password which you have set earlier.

10. We need to add the Source and Destination 
Environments for Move. Let's first add the source ESXi environment. 
**Click Add Environment**

     ![](./img/addenv.png)

11. In Select Environment Type, Select **VMware ESXi**

    ![](./img/esxi.png)

:::note

As you can see, Move supports different environment types including public clouds like
AWS and Azure
:::

12. Provide the details for the environment. Click **Add**

    - Environment Name : Any Name you like. We suggest Source ESXi.
    - vCenter Server : Provide the IP address: 10.42.198.40
    - username - PHX-POC###-User##@nutanixdc.local or DM#-POC###-User##@nutnaixdc.local. 
    The username is case sensitive
    - password - vCenter password

:::note
If you get an error about user not authorized, make sure the username is correct. 
The username is case sensitive and also uses the @nutanixdc.local domain.

13. Once the ESXi environment is validated and added, next lets add our 
destination Nutanix AHV cluster. Click **Add Environment**

    ![](./img/addenv2.png)

14. In Select Environment Type, Select Nutanix AOS and then provide the details 
for the environment. Click **Add**. 
**Remember this is the copy of PC residing in NC2**.

    - Environment Name : Any Name you like. We suggest Target AHV.
    - Nutanix Environment : Provide the IP address of PC
    - username - PC login - adminuser##@ntnxlab.local
   password - PC password

      ![](./img/addenv3.png)

15. Now repeat **steps 13 to 14** to add in NC2 environment as another destination. 

16. Now is a good time to pause for a minute while the Prism Central is added 
to the Move instance and it retrieves the inventory.

17. After a short pause you can proceed to the basic migration in **"Migrating 
VMs with Move"** with the link below.
