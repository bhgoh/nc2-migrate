# Environment Details

These bootcamps are intended to be run within the Nutanix Hosted POC (HPOC) environment.
Your cluster contains all the necessary images, network, and VMs to complete the exercises.

:::danger
Do not perform any upgrades to the environment, including but not limited to Prism Element (PE), Prism Central (PC), Acropolis Operating System (AOS), Nutanix Cluster Check (NCC), Foundation, any hardware-specific updates (ex. firmware), and any software within any remote sessions (ex. Graylog, Linux packages, PuTTY, Sublime Text).

Doing so will negatively impact your lab experience and potentially any other attendees using this cluster.

# Remote Connection

1. Follow the instructions provided in the email as pre-work prior to the actual day.
2. Follow the instructions provided to get connected either via VPN or #Parallels remote    
   desktop using the pre-assigned login credentials against your name.
3. Use Google Chrome Incognito mode to connect to the VDI environment.
4. Be patiemt while connecting to the VDI session and note that resizing or changing the VDI 
   resolution will result in reconnection, so it is not recommended.

:::warning

Always use applications within the remote session. Otherwise, the version you use may look or operate differently, negatively impacting your ability to complete the lab in the allotted time. Additionally, this aids with handling downloaded files, as all files would be within the remote session.
