## Conclusions

Congratulations on completing this lab. Migrating to Nutanix and especially to AHV is an important 
subject to our partners and customers. It is especially top of mind given the recent changes in the 
virtualization space. The following is a summary of what you should take away from this bootcamp:

  - You should be better prepared to have a conversation around a migration to Nutanix. There are far more 
    details to discover, discuss, and plan for beyond just how to execute the migrating a VM from VMware to AHV.

  - You should also have an understanding of some of the tools and processes you can use to do a migration. 
    Note the tools chosen may vary based on the size, complexity, requirements, and constraints of the project.

   - You've learned how to utilize Nutanix Move to perform VM and file share migrations. Move does simplify 
    the process of these types of migrations, but some workloads may require additional tools.

   - You also learned how the Nutanix Cloud Platform can easily help you manage your virtual infrastructure 
    day-to-day.

We hope this helped answer questions you have about migration to Nutanix. For those of us fortunate 
enough to be in the industry a while, we can see how this migration is much easier than the physical to virtual migrations of previous years.

Remember, the Nutanix Services organization is also well-versed in all types of migrations and can jump 
in to lend a hand with many aspects.
